# MCF assessment part 2 - Back-end

A metasearch engine for flights company, Flights Ltd, was greatly impressed by the frontend Single Page Application you have done. But the backend service you used were mock endpoints, and canâ€™t be deployed to production. Now the company has engaged you again to write a **high-quality production backend service**

## Requirements
You are required to create following endpoints and design the corresponding data structure.


- Get cities

```http
  GET /api/v1/cities
```


- Search for flights

```http
  GET /api/v1/flights
```
